Look for the following title (look down the page for the title, the search feature is poor):

<H4> Here is a short recipe to get Intel MKL up and running with R 3.6.2, just by copying across some of the Intel MKL BLAS files from Microsoft R Open to R 3.6.2, this is easier than having to recompile the whole of R against the Intel MKL libs</H4>

This recipe works cleanly now that MRO version 4.0.2 has been released and both RevoUtilsMath::getMKLthreads() and setMKLthreads() work again.  Note that the 'doParallel' package is on CRAN and can be easily downloaded from there.

 The get_num_cores() function, in the R CRAN package: 'RhpcBLASctl', is one way find the number of cores on a computer system. Hence:

      RevoUtilsMath::setMKLthreads(RhpcBLASctl::get_num_cores() - 1)
      
will reserve a single core for other work.  

#

Be careful since RhpcBLASctl::blas_set_num_threads() appears to work with MRO, with not only RhpcBLASctl::blas_get_num_procs() reporting the number of cores set, but even RevoUtilsMath::getMKLthreads() reports the same number of cores set. However, using the 'svdBenchMark' function in this repo it can be seen that the number of cores is not set properly. To see this, compare the following function calls :

     # The 'RevoUtilsMath' and 'RhpcBLASctl' packages need to be installed but not loaded 
     # install.packages('RhpcBLASctl')   
     
     set.seed(707)
     svdBenchMark(4000, cores = 1:6, MRO = TRUE, MKL = FALSE)
 
     set.seed(707)
     svdBenchMark(4000, cores = 1:6, MRO = FALSE, MKL = TRUE)

#

Tom Wenseleers' post also covers using Intel's latest (2019) files directly, however this currently (Nov 2021) does NOT work with R ver 4.X .

If Intel's files are directly moved under R ver 3.X, then the 'RhpcBLASctl' package functions will work (and svdBenchMark(..., MKL = TRUE) will also work correctly):

    # Patched R ver 4.X with files directly from Intel
    > blas_set_num_threads(4)
    detected function mkl_domain_set_num_threads
    
    > blas_get_num_procs()
    detected function mkl_domain_get_max_threads
    [1] 4


Note that sessionInfo() for a properly installed R-MKL on Linux (CentOS) will show a link to the Intel libraries:

    BLAS/LAPACK: /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2020.1.217/linux/mkl/lib/intel64_lin/libmkl_gf_lp64.so

Whereas, vanilla R-CRAN on Linux shows the standard libraries are used:

    BLAS:   /opt/R/64-bit/R-4.0.1/lib64/R/lib/libRblas.so
    LAPACK: /opt/R/64-bit/R-4.0.1/lib64/R/lib/libRlapack.so
    
But for a patched MRO ver 4.X on Windows or MKL ver 3.X on Windows, the sessionInfo()'s information doesn't change. 

#

Here are other benchmarking runs to try with svdBenchMark():

     # Under MRO
     svdBenchMark(600, cores = c(1, 3, 6), MRO = TRUE, MKL = FALSE)  # Quick ones first to see what happens
     svdBenchMark(c(400, 500, 600), cores = c(1, 3, 6), MRO = TRUE, MKL = FALSE)
     
     svdBenchMark(6000, cores = c(1, 3, 6), MRO = TRUE, MKL = FALSE)
     svdBenchMark(c(4000, 5000, 6000), cores = c(1, 3, 6), MRO = TRUE, MKL = FALSE)
     
     
     # Under MKL
     svdBenchMark(600, cores = c(1, 3, 6), MRO = FALSE, MKL = TRUE)  # Quick ones first to see what happens
     svdBenchMark(c(400, 500, 600), cores = c(1, 3, 6), MRO = FALSE, MKL = TRUE)
     
     svdBenchMark(6000, cores = c(1, 3, 6), MRO = FALSE, MKL = TRUE)
     svdBenchMark(c(4000, 5000, 6000), cores = c(1, 3, 6), MRO = FALSE, MKL = TRUE)

See the websites below for other benchmarking scripts and results. The benchmarking results vary between MRO and MKL when using the various benchmarking functions and scripts, with no clear winner revealed.
